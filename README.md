# Basketball Scoreboard

## What is this project?

This project was one of the first ones where I practiced JavaScript independently. 

You can log the score of a basketball game using this web app.

## The technologies used

- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript

## Implementations for the future

- The ability to subtract points from the score. For cases when the score has been entered incorrectly.
- A button that resets the scoreboard.
- Ability to save scores to a log so that game scores can be looked back on.
